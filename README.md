### Problem Statement
The project implements digit recognition from speech utterances using K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. MFCC or mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients have been extracted from .wav files and used as features for prediction task. 
The data contains 300 training files and 120 test files (.wav) which has speech utterances of various digits. The problem has been modelled as a multiclass problem and performance of model on each digit class is observed.
